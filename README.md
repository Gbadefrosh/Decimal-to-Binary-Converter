#  Decimal to Binary Converter (Recursive) â€“ Java

This Java console application converts any **non-negative decimal number** into its **binary equivalent** using **recursion**, with clear user input handling, loop control, and time complexity analysis.

---

##  Features

- Converts decimal numbers to binary using **recursive logic**
- Accepts both integer and decimal input (automatically truncates decimal part)
- Repeats conversion until the user chooses to exit
- Includes error handling for invalid input
- Displays time complexity explanation upon completion

---

##  Concepts Demonstrated

- **Recursion**
- **Input validation** (`try/catch`)
- **Loop control with user input**
- **Time and space complexity awareness**
- **Casting from double to int**
